<p> A geode is a rock that contains sparkling colored crystals inside. Some people are passionate about searching for geodes in nature, but for a fun indoor project, you can create your own resin geode art.</p>
<h2> What is Resin Geode? </h2>
<p>If you’re into arts and crafts and enjoy colorful, sparkly objects, you’ll love making your own resin geode. These can be relatively flat and created on a canvas or board, made into slices that can be used as coasters, or be larger and more sculptural. You can even learn how to make a resin geode table! Here’s how to make geode resin art.
 <p>You can create geode piece by folliowing these steps.</p>
  <p> 1. Take a canvas or MDF base</p>
   <p> 2. Take out your  resin part A and part B</p>
    <p>3. Safety gear: latex gloves, drop cloths, and apron (a respirator and safety glasses are highly recommended)</p>
    <p>4. Spatula and stir sticks</p>
    <p>5. Measuring jug or cup</p>
    <p>6. Masking tape </p>
    <p>7. Wet wipes and isopropyl alcohol</p>
    <p>8. Wooden or canvas panel (not a stretched canvas)</p>
    <p>9. Acrylic paints</p>
    <p>10. Decorative items like crystals, foils, glitter, glass globules, and acrylic gems </p>
    
    <p>Set everything up before you begin mixing the resin (always according to the instructions on the label). Wear an apron to protect your clothes, long sleeves and gloves to protect your skin, and a respirator and safety glasses for your face. Lay protective drop cloths over your table and floors.</p>

    <p>Tape up all four sides of your canvas so that any drips of resin are easy to clean up.</p>

    Finally, make sure your work surface is totally level (use a level marker, if you have one, to check this). Wet resin will dry lop-sided if your surface is uneven.
