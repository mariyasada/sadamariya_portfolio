        Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the
        visual impression of different typefaces Dummy text is text that is used
        in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which
        will later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for
        example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy text is also known
        as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy
        texts as lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made'
        text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use by
        typesetters since the 16th century.

      <h2>The usefulness of nonsensical content</h2>
      <p>
        Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different
        typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is
        nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
        non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to
        recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution
        of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from
        making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the
        typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout
        or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or
        less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
        patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates
        the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous
        when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout
        impression of the final publication is not compromised.
